I am a recent graduate from Habib University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, graduating with top honors. My academic and research journey has been driven by a passion for exploring the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics, and Extended Reality.

During my undergrad, I worked on both hardware and software projects, and I love finding ways to bring the two together. Anything that involves people and technology working side by side is where I feel most at home!

My research interests span across Extended Reality, Intelligent 3D User Interfaces, Multimodal Interaction, NLP, Context-Aware Systems, and Interactive Virtual Agents. I am also interested in 3D Human Motion Generation, Generative Networks, Procedural Generation, and 3D Computer Vision.

In terms of real-world applications, I focus on designing solutions for Education and Training using XR, enhancing learning experiences. I also explore Social VR to enable immersive, collaborative experiences in virtual environments. Beyond this, my work involves Multi-modal Interactions and Interactive AI-driven systems, aiming to make Interactive Systems more intuitive, Context-Aware, and capable of dynamic collaboration between humans and machines. 

With a natural curiosity and a strong drive for continuous learning, I am always eager to explore new domains and tackle emerging challenges within and adjacent to these fields.
